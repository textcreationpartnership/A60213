            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>IN <hi>Corduba,</hi> a principal City in <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> in a Convent among many others, lived a religious Fryer, for Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Parentage, and Behaviour, very much reſpected by all. It is the faſhion in the Monaſteries, that the younger Fryers go aſide by themſelves, and talk of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Matters amongſt them. Sometimes they meaſure the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61071:9"/>whole World in a Minute, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they diſpoſe of Kingdoms and States; now the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the paſt <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, another time the puiſſance of the <hi>Turcian</hi> Monarchy, is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Diſcourſe. Amongſt the reſt, it fell out one day, that they began to talk of Beauty, and every one gave in their Verdict, according as their Inclinations were bent to; ſome praiſing the Dames of their particular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, otherſome extolling thoſe they loved beſt. There was one amongſt them, a young Man of great Prudence and Modeſty, who hearing all their Diſcourſe, ſaid, What do you talk ſo much of the beautiful Dames of <hi>Madrid</hi> or <hi>Toledo?</hi> All the Perfections which ever mortal Creature can
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61071:9"/>be capable of, are contained in a Gentlewoman living at <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> Wife to a Lawyer, who is ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinent from all other Societies and Companies, that the very Citizens themſelves ſcarcely know her. He added to it the Lawyers Name, and ſome other particularities. The Diſcourſe being ended, every one did go to his Cell. Now Fryer <hi>Agilar</hi> (ſo was the Gentleman's Name we are ſpeaking of) being in his Chamber had time to overweigh the Words of the other Monk, and by them was ſo highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with Love towards the unknown and never-ſeen Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, that he almoſt was beſides himſelf, could never be at reſt; Eating and Drinking he did not care for, feeding himſelf only
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61071:10"/>with the Fancies now of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes Beauty. At laſt not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be ſubject to theſe his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and tormenting Paſſions reſolved to commit the greateſt Villany as ever could be inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or thought upon. He had an intimate Friendſhip and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with the Procurer not only of that Convent, but alſo of the whole Province, who had in his keeping and cuſtody all the Moneys of the Rents and Tithes belonging to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. Which having very large and rich Foundations, made the Revenues to be the bigger. It happened then that this <hi>Agilar</hi> one Winter Night, went to this Procurer's Chamber, and after they had exchanged many Words in a familiar Diſcourſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61071:10"/>betwixt them, they began to play at Drafts. <hi>Agilar</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe did always loſe, whereby the Procurer being accended (as commonly them that win are) did protract the Play till two of the clock, after Midnight; and being the time was ſo far ſpent, <hi>Agilar</hi> ſaid to the Procurer: Being it is ſo late, it is impoſſible for me to go to my Chamber, without being heard, and if any one ſhould perceive or hear me at this hour of commanded ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, I ſhould doubtleſs undergo a great Puniſhment. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer anſwered him, Father <hi>Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> for that you may eſcape this danger, there is no need you ſhould go to your Chamber, ſtay here with me, and lye with me in my Bed. Fryer <hi>Agilar</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61071:11"/>Becauſe the day is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching I will not undreſs my ſelf, but lye down ſo as I am up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of your Cheſts, till it be Day, and then go to my own Chamber. The Procurer being content with what he ſaid, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt himſelf, and lay down in his naked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed. Fryer <hi>Agilar,</hi> ſeeing the Procurer in a ſound Sleep, took a Dagger (which he had for that purpoſe made ready) and coming to his Bed-ſide, thruſt the Dagger into his Breſt, and ſo moſt cruelly murdered him. Afterwards taking the Keys out of his Pocket, went to the Cheſt wherein the Money was kept, and opening the ſame, (not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take any Silver Money becauſe of its heavineſs) took two thouſand Pieces of Gold.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61071:11"/>Having done that, he ſhuts the Procurer's Door after him, and eaſily getting over the Convent's Wall, betakes himſelf to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſe; where after he had knockt at the Door, the People of the Houſe opening the ſame, were all amazed at his ſo untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unſeaſonable coming, he being a Prieſt, and bound by the Canons of the Convent, not to abſent himſelf from his Chamber (being in City) about that time of Night: So they go to their Maſter, his Father, and tells him how that his Son Fryer <hi>Agilar,</hi> was there; Who extremely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring at his coming, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently enquire after the Reaſon of it. The Fryer preſently told him, how he had been at Drafts with the Procurer, and how in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61071:12"/>the midſt of the play they fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome quarrel, wherein the Procurer behaved himſelf ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly, that he abuſed him after the ſaddeſt rate in the World; which he not being able to ſuffer, took a Dagger, and made him ſpeechleſs by killing of him, whom he could not make hold his Tongue by civil Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions; and that he having lock'd his Door, betook himſelf to him, for to deſire him, becauſe he intended to go to <hi>Rome</hi> for an Abſolution, he might provide immediately all things neceſſary for him, for that there was no time for talking or ſtaying any longer. The Father very ſorry, with Tears and Sighs, for that great miſchance which happened to his Son, lamented his Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61071:12"/>and ſeeing there was no other Remedy gave him ſome Money, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next Morning after, he being in a Worldly Dreſs, returned to the City, and went to one of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friends, and having open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him the whole Concern, deſired that he might ſtay with him without fear, and that his Friend in the mean time, ſhould obſerve all what he heard of him, and enquire what the Monks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. But his Friend could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hear any thing of it, becauſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61071:13"/>the Monks either for fear of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, or ſome other cauſe, had bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Procurer, without having given the leaſt hint of it to any, beſides the Murtherers Father, who feigned himſelf to know nothing of the buſineſs. A Month after, having bought a Horſe, and all things convenient, he went to <hi>Oſſuna:</hi> where being arrived, he asked of his Landlord, what Men was there to be found which were renown'd of Wiſdom, Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Learning. The Landlord telling him of many, amongſt the reſt he mentioned the Curate of the City, whom he, as a wiſe old Man, and in his proceedings very ſage, did recommend above others.

The Curate told him of many, and amongſt the reſt, of the Husband of that Gentlewoman which he came

From thence he went direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Houſe of this Lawyer, and finding him at home, told him his Errand; as likewiſe how his Father had written a Letter from <hi>Mexico</hi> to the Curate, with whom he had been acquainted in his Youth, and had been his School-fellow: and ſince the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate had told him of his integrity of Life, and dexterity in his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he was willing and deſirous to live in his Houſe, not willing to be burthenſome to him in any thing, beſides in being informed by him in the practice of Law, for which his pains he would allow him fifty Crowns monthly. The Lawyer being ſomewhat jealous (as the Nature of <hi>Spaniards</hi> is) becauſe of his Wives Beauty, did view this young Gentleman

There he began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to her all the matter, how he was a Gentleman's Son, had heard of her Celeſtial Beauty, and not having ſeen her, fell in love with her, and how he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to be admitted into her Houſe; and having looked for many opportunities to disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his Thoughts before her, could never find any beſides this, therefore he falling at her Feet, embraced the ſame, deſiring Mercy and Clemency at her hands.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61071:20"/>or to have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of talking with her Captive Being with him, and overweigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was ſo dangerouſly Sick, and looked almoſt as Death and that for her ſake, ſhe turn'd Hatred into Love, and began thus to reaſon with him. Are you a Gentleman of a noble Blood, and loſe your Courage and Stoutneſs at the firſt ſtroke? do not you know, that not the firſt aſſaulting of the Enemy, but the perſeverance in the deſire of overcoming, carries away the Victory? Beſides, though Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen may have a good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination at the firſt ſight of their ſuppoſed Lovers, yet they will not let it be ſeen, for fear that ſooner yielding, ſhould cauſe a greater contempt of their dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61071:20"/>And if I ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to your Demands at your firſt propoſal, ſurely you had, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your long Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and long Travels, hated me as much as ever you loved me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Chear up therefore, and take a good Heart, and be careful of your Health and Recovery, which doing, you will oblige me to yeild to your deſires, as ſoon as ever you ſhall recover. The deſperate Fryer being erected by thoſe hopes began to mend, and in a very ſhort time after, quite recovered himſelf. After this the Lawyer's Wife inſtructed him, how he might come to her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſeen by any, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſuſpition of her Husband. As namely, that he ſhould fain himſelf to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61071:21"/>indiſpoſed, and deſire the Lawyer, her Husband, that no Body ſhould come to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to diſturb him; and then ſhe would look for an opportunity to let him into her Chamber, and hide him behind the Curtains, till her Husband ſhould fall aſleep, and then ſhe would admit him into her Company: And this ſhe did, becauſe her Husband was ſo jealous, that he always lock'd the Door of his Chamber on the inſide, ſo that neither ſhe could come out, nor he come in. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this their Agreement the buſineſs was done. And the Lawyer (as the faſhion there is) having lock'd all the Doors, and taken the Keys with him, went to Bed, The Eccho of this Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Sickneſs, came to the Curates
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61071:21"/>Ears; who either out of Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this Gentleman, or elſe for the love of the Money he had in his Cuſtody, came that very ſame Night to viſit him, and knocking hard at the Door made the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer riſe out of his Bed; He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming down, ask'd him, who it was that knock'd ſo hard at the Door? The Curate anſwered it was he, and that he hearing of his Son's (ſo he call'd this Fryer's) indiſpoſition could not forbear but come to him. The Lawyer anſwered. He might ſpare his pains, for that the Gentleman had deſired not to be troubled by any, and he, becauſe of his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, was bound to do him that kindneſs, as to admit to his Chamber no Body, whatever he might be. But the Curate inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61071:22"/>much upon it, that he would ſee him whatſoever ſhould be come of it, and obliging very much the Lawyer to admit him to the ſpeech of his Son, he at laſt had the Door open'd to him, and both he and the Lawyer went to his Chamber Door, which he finding open immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately went in, and not finding him within, preſently ſuſpected ſomething extraordinary, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially remembring his great courteſies he ſhewed to his Wife, and that noiſe we ſpoke of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing higher, he began to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of her, and at laſt concluded he muſt neceſſarily be with her. Still he diſſembled all his ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before the Curate, and ſaid, May be he is gone out for ſome while, to take the freſh Air, in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61071:22"/>this cool Night, and finding him ſelf to be ſomewhat better than before, he ſtays a little longer than ordinary. The Curate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied by theſe Words, took his leave of the Lawyer, and went his ways; after whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, the Lawyer (as we told you) perceiving the buſineſs, goeth immediately towards his Chamber, and taking his naked Sword in his hand ſearches for the Traitor; which the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman ſeeing, out of love to her new Servant, goeth towards her Husband, and puts out the Candle. After this, Fryer <hi>Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> being a luſty ſtout young Man, takes hold of the Lawyer, wrings his Sword out of his Hands, and kills him immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his own Weapon. The
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61071:23"/>Servants of the Houſe, as well a other Neighbours, hearing the great tumult and noiſe, which thoſe two Combatants had made did altogether riſe, and cauſing the Door to be broke open, ſaw the Lawyer Murthered, and took Fryer <hi>Agilar</hi> Priſoner, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman in the mean time eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into a Nunnery. There was the beginning of this doleful Womans Tragedy, and a part of the Fryer's innumerable Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Now this Gentlewoman having been a long time in the place of her Refuge, at laſt would be in the uſe of a greater Liberty, and by the means of her Friends, and Relations was ſent to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther City a great ways diſtant from <hi>Oſſuna.</hi> Being there ſhe bearing a kindneſs for this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                        </hi> receiving this Letter was extremely affected with it, not knowing how in the mean time to contrive, that he might get looſe, or break out of Priſon.

He notwithſtanding that did not ceaſe to give her viſits: But not being able to obtain any thing of her, it hapned once they were both by themſelves in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where he having received

                     <p>Once he met with a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and perceiving what he was, demanded of him what was beſt for a heavy obſtinated Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.

But the Fryer anſwering he could take nothing in of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Chirurgion replyed, there was another way of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, by a Glyſter, whom the Fryer as if he had not known what it was, ask'd how it might be, and proceeding, (he telling him it was conveyed to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals

So he commanded his Men to take hold of him, and having filled a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Horn full with Gunpowder, cauſed the ſame to be ſtop'd into his Breech, and afterwards made the top of the Horn very cloſe, which being done he commanded the Powder ſhould be kindled, and this being done alſo, the good Chirurgion was rent in pieces, and ſo lamentably loſt his life.</p>

They reported this to the Abbeſs, who not being able to apprehend the meaning of it, caus'd immediately all her Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be taken notice of, and made her lie with Company. When ſhe ſaw her ſelf kept ſo cloſe, ſhe made her complaints to her Gallant, who induced her to revenge her ſelf, and to ſet the Covent on fire. The Enemy gave her the Fire his own ſelf, and aſſiſted her to begin at the faireſt place of all the Lodgings in the Abby.

It was about eleven a Clock at Night, when the darkneſs cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things with ſilence, when
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61071:56"/>this infernal Fury, roſe out of her Bed ſhe lay in, and going out of her Chamber entred into her Mothers Chamber, who was in a faſt ſleep upon her chaſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Bed, the youngeſt Son of the ſix, of about five or ſix years of age, was lying at her ſide. The Paricide with a great and large Knife, drew near to the Bed, and ſo promptly cuts the Throat of her, from whom ſhe had received Life, that the poor Gentlewoman could not as much as cry out. An old Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lay next to her, who having leap'd out of the Bed, runs haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards her Miſtreſs, and finding her weltring in her own Blood, ſlang open the Window of her Chamber, and began to cry out for help.

Having recovered his Spirits, he runs to the next Chamber, &amp; catches up a Sword, to revenge upon this execrable Woman the Death of ſo good a Mother: And he had undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly done it, had he not been prevented by ſome that were thereabouts, who laid open to him, That in a matter of ſuch conſequence the common courſe of Law was to be taken, and not a private Revenge to be uſed; and therefore they forced the Sword out of his hand. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, the grief which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61071:57"/>at this ſad accident, made him vomit out many reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Words againſt the Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, and put in him ſo great a deſire of Revenge, that he could not be hindred from beating her with his Fiſts, and disfiguring her Face with his Nails; and if they had not drawn her away, he had certainly ſtrangled her. This Wretch was preſently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by a Safe-guard, expecting the coming of the doleful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who came two or three days after. But who can ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expreſs his grief! to find ſo ſweet a Companion, with whom he had lived ſo long in peace and quietneſs, bereaved of Life by her to whom ſhe gave it. <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſaid the ſorrowful Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman) <hi>I muſt needs have greatly

How comes it that I had ſo little wiſdom, to leave you here alone, without adviſing with my ſelf about the cruel Deſigns of this Infernal Fury? If I had been here, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure this execrable Wretch had turned her hands upon me, and my death had been a ſafeguard for your life, for the love of which, I would have ſacrificed my own a thouſand times. O cruel Viper! what Puniſhment can one invent, which ſhould be anſwerable to thy unnatural deſerts?</hi> Thus this good Gentleman lamented, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning all patience and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61071:58"/>and giving himſelf wholly over to his grief.

                     <p>Afterwards he cauſed his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Daughter to be encloſed betwixt four Walls, and a true Information to be taken of the horrid Crime by her committed.

                     <head>An abominable Cruelty of a Fryer, committed for the accompliſhing of his deteſtable Lechery, and the enſuing Puniſhment for it.</head>
                     <p>IN the Dominions of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Maximilanus</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> was a Convent of Fryers, of great eſteem, near unto which a Gentleman of Quality had his Houſe. This, had ſuch a great kindneſs for theſe Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that for their ſake and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, nothing was ſo dear to him, but he would have parted with it, thereby to have a part in their good works, faſting, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtizings of themſelves. And amongſt the reſt there was a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and well ſhaped Fryer, whom
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61071:60"/>the Gentleman choſe for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Confeſſor. Which had ſo much Power to command in the Gentlemans Houſe, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman himſelf. This Fryer ſeeing the Gentlemans Lady ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry handſome and wiſe, ſo that ſhe had but very few for her equals, fell in love with her ſo far, that he could neither eat nor drink, and was beraved of his natural reaſon. One day, being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to execute his Intention, did go all alone to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Houſe, and not having found him, ask'd the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whither he was gone. She anſwered him that he was gone to one of his Lands, where he was to ſtay, two or three days; nevertheleſs if he had any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with him, ſhe would ſend
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61071:60"/>an expreſs to him. He ſaid no, he had none: And began to walk up and down the Houſe, as one that had ſome buſineſs of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in his head. And after he had departed out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhe ſaid to one of her Maids (there being but two of them.) Goe after the good Father, and ſee whither he goeth, for me thinks he looks as if he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented. The Chambermaid went into the Court, asking him if he would have any thing. Yes, anſwered the Fryer, and drawing her into a Corner takes out a Ponyard, which he had in his Sleeve, and with that cut her Throat. Juſt when he had done the miſchief, comes in into the ſame Court, one of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans Servants, on Horſ back,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61071:61"/>bringing the Tents of a Farm. As ſoon as he had lighted, the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er runns to him, who in Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him, cuts his Throat from behind, and ſhuts the Door of the Caſtle after him. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, ſeeing her Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid did not come again, did admire why ſhe ſtaid ſo long with the Fryer; and ſaid to her other Chambermaid; Go and ſee what's the matter that your Comerade doth not come again. The Chambermaid goeth to him, whom as ſoon as he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, taketh her by the hand, and draws her into a Corner, and doeth the ſame to her as he did to the other, At laſt, ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be all alone in the Houſe, he went to the Gentlewoman, telling her how he a long time
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61071:61"/>ago had been in love with her, and that the hour was come, wherein ſhe muſt obey him. She who never thought ſuch a thing ſhould come to paſs, ſaid to him, Good Father, I did not believe I ſhould have had ſo bad an Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this, that you would throw the firſt ſtone at me your own ſelf. The Fryer told her, go into the Court and you ſhall ſee what I have done. When ſhe ſaw both her Chambermaids and her Foot Man dead, ſhe was ſo highly taken with fear, that ſhe ſtood like a ſtock unmoveable. Preſently the miſchievous Man, that would not have her only for an hours pleaſure, would not take her by force, but ſaid to her, <hi>Madam,</hi> be not afraid, you are in the hands of a Man, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61071:62"/>and eſteemeth you above all the World. Saying thus, he pull'd off his large Habit, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the which he had one a deal leſſer, which he preſented to the Lady, ſaying to her, that if ſhe would not take it, he would put her amongſt the number of the Dead, which ſhe ſaw before her eyes. The Gentlewoman more dead than alive, reſolved to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that ſhe would obey him to ſave her life, as well as to gain ſome time, by which ſhe hoped her Husband would come again. And by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of this aforeſaid Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or began to undreſs her ſelf as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily as ever ſhe could. And when ſhe was come to her Hair, the Fryer not regarding the beauty it had, cut it off, very haſtily
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61071:62"/>and that being done, he made her to unſtrip her ſelf to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Smock, and to put on that little habit, which he had brought underneath his uſual one, and as haſtily as he could, departed from their Houſe, carrying along with him, his petty Fryer, for whom he had long'd ſo much. But the Lord, who hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the Innocent in the day of their trouble, did look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tears of this doleſul Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, in ſo much that her Husband having diſpatcht his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines ſooner than he thought or told to any, was returning by the ſame Path, where his Wife was going over. The Fryer perceiving him a far off, ſaid to the Gentlewoman it is your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that I ſee a coming there. I
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61071:63"/>know if he ſhould ſee you, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> my hands, therefore goe a little before me, and do not turn your head here nor there; for if you ſhould make the leaſt Sign, or Wink, my Ponyard ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately at your Throat, and there ſhall be no body able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you out of my hands. When they were thus talking the Gentleman was nigh to him, and ask'd him from whence he came. He anſwered him, from your Houſe, where I left the Madam, your Wife, in a good health, waiting for your coming home. The Gentleman did go on in his way, without any perceiving of his Wife. But the Servant that was with him, who always uſed to entertain the Fryers Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61071:63"/>called <hi>Fryer John,</hi> began <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>and, anſwered him nothing at all, but the Footman to ſee the Face, lifted up the broad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ape, when the Gentlewoman, ſpeaking not one word to him, made ſome Signs with her Eyes, full of Mourning and Tears. The Footman riding behind his Maſter, ſaid to him thus; Sir, by lifting up the Cape of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Comerade, I perceived it was not <hi>Fryer John,</hi> but was like my Miſtreſs, your Wife, who did caſt a piteous look upon me, with an eye full of Tears. The Gentleman anſwered him, he was out of his Wits, and knew not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61071:64"/>what he ſaid. But the Foot-man perſiſting in his Sayings, deſired the Gentleman to give him leave to purſue them, and to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he ſaw under the Cape was that he thought to be. The Gentleman gave his conſent to it, and ſtaid there to ſee what news his Foot-man ſhould bring him back. But when the Fryer heard ſome body behind him, calling, <hi>Father John,</hi> doubting the Gentlewoman had been known, came towards the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with a great ſtick ſet about with Iron, which he had in his hand, and gave ſo hard a batt upon his ſhort Ribs, that he ſtruck him off the Horſe, down to the ground. And immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately falling upon him, cut his Throat: The Gentleman who

                        </gap>ed, thinking he had tumbled down by ſome miſfortune or other, run preſently after him to help him. And as ſoon as the Fryer ſaw him, he gave him a like blow with his Stick, as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>had done to his Foot-man, and pulling him down off his Horſe, threw himſelf upon him; but the Gentleman being a ſtrong and an able Man, took hold of the Fryer in that manner, that he left him no power whereby he might hurt him, and made the Ponyard to fall out of his hand, which the Gentlewoman preſently took up, and gave it to her Husband, and with all her force took the Fryer by his hair, her Husband giving him in the mean time, ſeveral Stabs
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61071:65"/>with the Ponyard, in ſo much that he beg'd Pardon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to him all the truth of his Wickedneſs. The Gentleman would not kill him; but deſired his Wife, to go to their Houſe, and to look for ſome of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and that they might bring thither a Chariot, which ſhe did. And afterwards, having ſtript her ſelf of her Habits, run in her Smock only, to her Houſe. Immediately all the Servants run to aſſiſt their Maſter, and to ſee what Prey he had got, and they found him in that ſame Net wherein he was catcht, and ſo carried him to the Gentlemans Houſe, who afterwards ſent him to the Juſtice of the Emperour, into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he pleaded Guilty, diſcovering his Wicked
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61071:65"/>Intention: And it was found out by the Commiſſaries about him, and confirmed by his own Confeſſion, that there was brought into that Monaſtery (which he was of) a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Noble Dames, and other Beautiful Gentlewomen by that ſame means, by which this Fryer would have brought in this our Gentlewoman, whom the Lord delivered out of his great Mercy, who alwaies gives aid and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to them that relie upon him. After this, the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was deprived of all its Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Revenews, and the Monks that were within, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Gentlewomen, and the Covent, were all burned to Aſhes for perpetual Memory of the committed Crime.</p>

                     <p>IN the Country of <hi>Perigord</hi> in <hi>France</hi> there was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who was ſo devout to Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> that he thought every body who did wear his Habit to be like him, He did honour ſo much that Saint, that, the better to ſhew his Devotion towards him, he kept in his own Houſe Chambers fit to lodge thoſe of that Order; and by them he govern'd all his Affairs, thinking to wak ſurely, as long as he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their Advices.</p>
                     <p>It hapned one day, that the Wife of the ſaid Gentleman, who

Whilſt they were at Supper, came in a Monk, his Ghoſtly Father, (from whom he did hide no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) of which the Gentleman was very glad. After ſeveral Diſcourſes between his Wife, his Brother, and the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they ſate down to Supper, and when they were eating and drinking, the Gentleman look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Wife, who was beautiful enough to be deſired, made this Queſtion to his Ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61071:86"/>you. At this preſent he ſends word by me, that he will come to you one of theſe nights, and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a while with you. But he being an Angel, if he ſhould come in the ſhape of an Angel, you could not touch him, he acquaints you with it, that he will come in the ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This antick Madam anſwered how ſhe was greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with joy and pleaſure, for being loved by the Angel <hi>Gabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and therefore ſhe loved him alſo, neither ſhould ſhe ſee an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of him, where ſhe ſhould
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61071:87"/>not light a wax Candle before it, and he might chooſe what hour he pleas'd himſelf to come, and ſhould be very welcome, and find her all alone in her Chamber, provided he ſhould not leave her becauſe of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom as ſhe thought he wiſhed well, and was ſo obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to her, that every where, whereſoever ſhe ſaw the Virgin, ſhe alſo ſaw him kneeling before her, and as then, ſhe left it to himſelf to come in what ſhape he pleas'd, becauſe ſhe was not at all affraid of him. Fryer <hi>Robert</hi> preſently anſwered; Madam, you ſpeak very wiſely, and I ſhall order with him the buſineſs, you ſpoke of, very well; but you could do me a great kindneſs, and it ſhould coſt you nothing;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61071:87"/>and it is this, that you may be willing to permit he ſhould come in this my body. And herein you will ſhew me a great kindneſs; He entring into my Body, will take my Soul out of it, and ſend it into Paradiſe, and as long as he ſtays with you my Soul ſhall ſtay there. This good Madam immediately an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers: <hi>I am content, and will that you may have this conſolation, in recompence of thoſe ſtripes which you ſuffered for my ſake.</hi> Fryer <hi>Robert,</hi> thus again, <hi>You will order it ſo, that this very ſame night, he may find the Gates <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61071:88"/>anſwered, ſhe would do it. So the Fryer <hi>Roberto</hi> departed, and ſhe that was left behind, was ſo proud and ſo glorious, that ſhe thought not her ſhift good enough to touch her back: That ſhort time, in which ſhe was to ſtay for the Angel, ſeemed to her a thouſand years. Fryer <hi>Robert</hi> had got permiſſion to go with a Commerad to one of his Friends at night. Where he was very well known. From thence, the time being ſhort, he did go to the Gentlewomans houſe, and in the very entring, with thoſe Trincket he had about him, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd himſelf into an Angel, and without being perceived by any, very eaſily did go to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Liſetta.</hi> Who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him going in all in white,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61071:88"/>preſently fell down upon her knees before him, and the Angel gave her a bleſſing, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving boar her up by her hand, made a ſign ſhe ſhould go to Bed: She being willing to obey, did it preſently, and the Angel inſtantly accompanied his devout Lady. Lying with her, he many things related to her about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Coeleſtial. At laſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching light of the then riſing Sun, invited him to depart, and he taking his Trumperies, and the reſt of the Apparel with him, bid her farewell. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman after ſhe had Dined with one of her Companions, went directly to Fryer <hi>Robert,</hi> and told him all the news about the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> as likewiſe, what ſhe had heard of him about the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61071:89"/>glory of the life everlaſting, and how he was made, adding to it of her own other wonderful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. To which Fryer, <hi>Robert</hi> replyed. <hi>Madam, I do not know how you have houſed with him; that I know well, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me that ſame night, and I having delivered your Embaſſy to him, ſuddenly carried my Soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many ſweet Flowers and Roſes, as I never ſaw before, and ſet me in one of the moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full places of the World, where it was, till this very morning, what in the mean time hapned to my Body, I do not know: I will not tell you,</hi> ſaid the Gentlewoman; <hi>Your body was all night long with the Angel</hi> Gabriel <hi>in my Arms.</hi> And after many ſuch ſtories as theſe ſhe returned home again,

This ſame Mr. <hi>Capelleto</hi> came into Sir <hi>Muſcatos</hi> mind, who intirely knowing his manner of Life, thought him the fitteſt Perſon, that ever could be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mr. <hi>Capelleto,</hi> who ſee himſelf in ſtreights, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by neceſſity, without deliberation, anſwered, he would willingly obey his Command. So they went together, and Mr. <hi>Capelleto</hi> having received his orders, and Favourable Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the King, departed from Mr. <hi>Muſcato</hi> in his way for <hi>Burgundy</hi> where he was known by no Body. There, contrary to his Nature, he with great Modeſty and a deal of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility began to recover the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and to do that which he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61071:98"/>was ſent for thither. So doing, he repaired to a Houſe of two Brothers of <hi>Florence,</hi> to Lodge there; theſe were Uſurers, and for the Love of Sir <hi>Muſcate,</hi> they Honoured him very much; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, it hapned he fell Sick, to whom theſe two Brothers cauſed preſently ſome Phyſicians to come, and Nurſes to ſerve him, there was nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whatſoever was requiſit for the recovery of his Health. But all this help availed nothing; for the good Gentleman, who was already old, and had lived very diſorderly, grew (according to the ſaying of the Phyſicians.) every day worſe and worſe, and was already combating with Death, which theſe two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were exceeding ſorry for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61071:99"/>And one day being very near to the Chamber, where Mr. <hi>Caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lleto</hi> lay Sick, began to talk between themſelves, ſaying one to another, what ſhall we do with this Man? We have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad buſineſs under our hands. For if we put him out of Dores, as he is now Sick and Weak, a great murmuring of People will ariſe, neither will it be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mient of great wiſdom in us, but a manifeſt ſign of folly, if after we have firſt received him cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and then made him to be attended, and carefully to be cured, ſhould now without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received any diſpleaſure at his hands, ſo ſuddenly throw him out of our Houſe, in this weak and deadly condition. On the otherſide, he is a Man ſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61071:99"/>wicked, that he will not yield to go to confeſſion, neither can be perſwaded to receive any of the Sacraments of the Church, and if he dies without confeſion there is not one Church will bury him, ſo that he muſt be thrown into ſome hole after the manner of a Dog. And if he ſhould confeſs, his Sins are ſo great and horrible that there is none like to be found, for which ſake the Prieſt that will hear him if he would, ſhall not be able to abſolue him, and he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolved ſhall nevertheleſs be thrown into ſome Dunghil. And if this ſhould fall out, the People of this Country ſeeing this, either becauſe of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which they judge to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and every day ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleto,</hi> who (as we told you,) did lye next to that place where they thus diſcourſed, having a very ſharp hearing, (as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſee the Sick have,) did hear all they ſaid of him. Whom he made to be called, and ſaid to them. I deſire you heartily not to doubt any thing about
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61071:100"/>me. nor to have any fear of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any Damage by me. I have underſtood what you have ſpoke together of me, and am aſſured that things will not run ſo as you conceived they ſhould, but they ſhall run quite contrary ways. I have done ſo many injuries to the Almighty in my Life, that if I doe one more in the Hour of my Death, I do not think there ſhall be one more or leſs. Therefore procure the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt and the moſt underſtanding Fryer you can find to come to me, (if any ſuch can be found.) And leave the reſt to me, for I will ſo heatly accommodate your buſineſs and mine, that your ſelf ſhall judge it to be well done, and ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied. The two Brothers who had no hopes of

Wherefore the ſaid <hi>Siſter Mary</hi> fearing to Sin againſt the vow of her Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, did look him in the Face,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61071:118"/>but ſhe perceived him ſo ugly and deform'd; that ſhe thought ſhe had undergone a greater Penance, than committed Sin, in looking him in the Face this Holy Father after that he had diſplayed the beſt Flowers of his <hi>Rhetorick</hi> in declaring his great reſpects and Cordial Affections towards her, he preſently clapt his hand upon her Breaſt, but ſhe according to her duty thruſted him back, and he being in a great fume Exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt her ſaying, What? muſt a Religious Nunn know that ſhe hath Teats, ſhe forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with replyed, Yea I know that I have them, and alſo that you, and ſuch as you are ought not to lay hands on them, for I am not ſo young nor ignorant, but that I know right well what is a ſin,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61071:118"/>and what is not; but he well perceiving that he could not win the place by ſuch Stratagems, he reſolved to turn over a new leaf, in telling her, Alas, dear Siſter, I muſt needs declare to you my great extremity; and the caſe is this, I am troubled with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper which all Phyſicians do judge incurable, unleſs I take ſome paſtime with a Woman that I love very well; as for me I do not eſteem my life ſo much but that I would rather chuſe to dye than to commit a mortal ſin, but if the buſineſs did proceed ſo far, it is well known that the ſimple ſin of Fornication is no way to be parallell'd with the ſin of Murder; wherefore if you love my life it is in your power to ſave it, and together to free
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61071:119"/>your Conſcience from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Cruelty. But ſhe, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, asked him what kind of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime he meant to take; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her, that ſhe might very well repoſe her Conſcience upon his, and that he would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that could any way turn to the prejudice of either of them, and to ſhew her a prelude of that paſtime he required, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently embracing her, did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with all his ſtrength to caſt her upon the Bed; but ſhe by this time perceiving his wicked intent, what by words and what by deeds did defend her ſelf ſo well, that notwithſtanding all his buſtle and chafing he had power to touch nothing but her Cloaths. Now when he ſaw that all his endeavours and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61071:119"/>were but in vain, as an enraged man, and one that had put off all ſenſe of Conſcience and of Natural Reaſon, clapt his hand under her Coats, and ſo f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the Abbeſs having heard her out-cry, forthwith en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Dormitory where ſhe was, and remembring that ſhe had left her Neece all alone with that good Father, and ſmitten in her Conſcience, did thruſt the door which the young Monk held faſt. Now this holy Prior hearing that the Abbeſs her ſelf was at the door, cauſed it to be opened, and ſhewing her her Neece on the ground in a ſwoon, told her; Certainly, Madam,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61071:120"/>you are very much to blame that you never informed me of the diſpoſitions of Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> for I being altogether ignorant of the weak diſpoſition of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, cauſed her to ſtand all the while I was checking of her, and ſo as you ſee ſhe is fallen into a ſwoon. They did with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and other fit things, at laſt recover her out of her ſwoon, and found that by her fall ſhe had got a hurt in her head. Now being come to her ſelf, the Prior fearing leſt ſhe ſhould declare to the Abbeſs, who was her Aunt, the Cauſe of her illneſs, told her ſecretly by her ſelf, Daughter I forbid you upon pain of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and of eternal Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from ever ſpeaking or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing any thing that I have

                     <p>Now Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> had been forewarned by one of the Nuns, who was her intimate Friend, and one who underſtood all the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61071:127"/>Intrigue, that in caſe ſhe plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her ſelf, and ſhould caſt out any word that ſhould diſtaſte the ſaid Prior, that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cauſe her to be thrown <hi>in pace,</hi> that is to ſay, into a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Dungeon, ſhe therefore pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſuffered this ſentence, and lifting up her hands and eyes to Heaven, earneſtly prayed to God the avenger of the innocent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him that as he had been her ſafeguard, and had hitherto afforded her grace to reſiſt all the allurements unto ſin, ſo he would be pleaſed to arm her with a Chriſtian patience in her great tribulation. Moreover this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful Prior commanded, that ſhe within the term of three years enſuing, ſhould not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſpeak to any of her
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61071:128"/>Parents or Kindred, if at any time they came to viſit her, and that ſhe ſhould write no Letters but before the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nuns: So that after this wicked wretch had fulfilled his rage againſt this innocent Maid, he went his way, and never came more there. This poor Nun was left a very long time in the diſgrace and diſtreſs above mentioned; but her Mother, who loved her even above all her other Children, ſeeing ſhe heard no more of her, was in a great perplexity, and told one of her Sons, who was a wiſe and diſcreet Gentleman, that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her Daughter was dead, and that the Nuns, to the end they might ſtill receive her year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Penſion, did conceal her death;

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61071:129"/>did accompany her, and ſtood ſo near that ſhe could reveal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of her mind to her Brother, but ſhe being wiſe and diſcreet had well foreſeen that, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had ſecretly committed to writing all the paſſages before mentioned, and a thouſand other ſtratatagems which the ſaid Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or had uſed on purpoſe to inveigle her, the which becauſe they would be too long and too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to rehearſe, for brevity ſake I will omit; but I muſt not forget mentioning that whileſt her Aunt was yet Abbeſs, he thinking he had ſuffered a repulſe becauſe of his deformity, he cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a young and beautiful Monk to intice this chaſt Nunn to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, hoping, that if by Love ſhe ſhould yield to that young
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61071:129"/>Monk, he could afterwards win her by fear: This young Monk, entertained her with ſo vile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and ſo obſcene actions, in a Garden where he was with her, that I think my ſelf obliged to ſpare chaſt Ears, ſeeing I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not relate them without a bluſh, inſomuch, that this honeſt poor Nun was forced to jump and run but of the Garden to the Abbeſs, who was then ſpeaking with that Prior, and with a great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, told her, Dear Mother, they that come to viſit our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent are Devils under Religious Monks Couls.

The Dean anſwered again, Madam do not doubt of that, and if it be poſſible agree, that we may be together this ſame Evening. The Gentlewoman ſaid; I am ſatisfied, and ſhe gave him or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, when and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ſhould come; ſo ſhe depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him and went home. This Gentlewoman had one of her ſervants which was not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>young already, and had a very ugly look with her, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured as any Woman in the World; for ſhe had a Noſe as an Eagle and a wrye mouth, broad Lips, the Teeth quite out of order, and as well big, as black, and her Breath ſtunk moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominably,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61071:143"/>moreover her Eyes were always dropping, and her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ace was all yellow and green, and above all this ſhe was crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſomewhat lame on her right ſide, and her Name was <hi>Porca.</hi> And as well as ſhe was disfigured as to her Perſon, ſo ſhe was ſomewhat maliceful, whom the Gentlewoman call'd to her ſelf and ſaid, heark you <hi>Porca.</hi> if you will do me one Service to night, I'le give thee a brave new Smock, <hi>Porca</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mention made of the Smock, anſwered, Madam if you give me a Smock, I will throw my ſelf into the fire, beſides any thing elſe you will be pleas'd to command me. Well, ſaith the Gentlewoman, I will have you to lye this night with a man in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61071:144"/>my own Bed, and I deſire you to coaks him up, but take heed leaſt you make any ſtir for fear you ſhould be heard by my Bretheren, for you know they lye next to my room, and then I will give you the Smock. The <hi>Porca</hi> anſwered, What matter is it if I lye with ſix, not only with one. The Evening being come, Maſter Dean came according as he had been appointed, and the two young Gentlemen accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what they agreed to, were in their own Chamber, and made a noyſe, for that they might be heard. Wherefore the Dean very eaſily in the dark en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Gentlewomans Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and as ſhe had told him went to Bed, and on the other ſide laid Madam <hi>Porca,</hi> who was well
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61071:144"/>informed by her Miſtris how to act her Part. Mr. Dean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving he had the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at his ſide, kindly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Madam <hi>Porca.</hi> This the Gentlewoman having perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe charged her Brothers, to do the Remnant of this Comedy. Who going very quietly out of their Chamber, went towards the Market, and fortune, in what they had under hands favoured them above their Deſires, for it being very hot Weather, the Biſhop had asked for them two young Gentlemen, that ſo he might go to their Houſe, and drink with them. But he ſeeing them come, having obtained his deſire, went directly with them, and entred into a cold Vault of theirs, where there was a great
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61071:145"/>many Candles burning, and there he drunk a Glaſs of their good Wine, with very great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. After he had drunk it, the young Gentlemen ſaid, My Lord, ſince you have been pleaſed to ſhew us this kindneſs, as to dignifie us with your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in this our ſmall Cottage, into which we was coming to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite you. We deſire you, that it may pleaſe you, to go to a little Chamber of ours. which we are ambitious to ſhew you. The Biſhop anſwered, he would willingly conſent to it. Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of the young Gentlemen, taking a lighted Torch into his Hand, and going before him, the Biſhop and all the reſt following him, did directly go towards the Chamber, where Maſter Dean
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61071:145"/>did lie with Madam <hi>Porca.</hi> So the young Gentleman entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chamber, the Biſhop after him, and after the Biſhop all the Train; to whom Maſter Dean with Madam <hi>Porca</hi> in his Arms was exhibited. Maſter Dean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered in that nature, and ſeeing the Candle and all the People about him, being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſhamed, and not leſs afraid, did put his Head under the Sheets. To whom the Biſhop ſpoke extream angrily, calling him a Villain and a Rogue, and made him to put out his Head from under the Sheets, for that he might ſee who he lay withal. The Dean ſeeing himſelf to be cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Gentlewoman; either for that, or elſe for ſhame of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chidden (as he thought it
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61071:146"/>would happen) ſuddenly grew as ſad as can be imagined; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put his Cloaths on, by the Commandment of the Biſhop, was ſent to Priſon, for to ſuffer there a Puniſhment anſwerable to his deſerts. Afterwards the Biſhop defired to know, how this buſineſs came about, that he went to lye with Madam <hi>Porca.</hi> The young Gentlemen told him all the circumſtances of the Matter. Which the Biſhop having heard, praiſed much the Gentlewoman, and the Gentlemen alſo, that without being deſirous to defile their Hands in the Blood of the Fryer, had treated him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he deſerved.</p>

                     <p>AT <hi>Siena,</hi> there was a young Gentleman, very gallant, and of a good Family, whoſe Name was <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> that fell in Love with a Neighbour of his, a Gentlewoman of a great Beauty, and a Wife to a very rich Man; Who hoping to find out a way, to ſpeak to her without any Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition; and thereby to obtain his deſire, did not ſee any other, beſides that he might come to be her Goſſip, the Gentlewoman being at that time big with Child, ſo he made himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61071:147"/>with her Husband after the beſt manner he could, and in a very honeſt way he told him his Ambition, and the buſineſs was doue. Now <hi>Rinaldo</hi> being Goſſip of Madam <hi>Agnetta,</hi> and having under this colour got a very good occaſion of talking with her, reſolved to make her know his Intention by words, which ſhe a long time ago had perceived out of the motion of his Eyes. But he effected very little, though it was not unplea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſant to the Gentlewoman to hear him thus talking. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it happened that <hi>Rinaldo</hi> (whatſoever the occaſion was) became a Fryer. And it fell out, that he for ſome time put his love a ſide, which he bore to his Goſſip, as likewiſe ſome other of his Vanities; but in proceſs of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61071:147"/>time, reaſſumed that ſame Habit which he never had put off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and began to delight in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Apparel, and to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Suits of the beſt Cloath, and to be gallant and handſome in all his things, and to make Songs, Ballads and Sonnets, and to ſing the ſame, with other things of the like nature, which he was full of. So that at laſt, his former Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites being come again to him, he began oftentimes to viſit his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſip, and his boldneſs very much increaſing above the firſt, he alſo began to Sollicit her for that which he was deſirous to obtain from her. The good Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being ſo much and ſo often Sollicited, and Fryer <hi>Rinaldo</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing a great deal handſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer than before, was, above the reſt, one day ſo much ſaluted by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61071:148"/>that it came to paſs, ſhe be came willing to do all thoſe things which he demanded of her, and ſaid; <hi>How now Father</hi> Rinaldo, <hi>does the Eryers do alſo ſuch things.</hi> To which he Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Madam, as ſoon as ever I pull this Cap down my Back, which I can do very eaſily, I l'evappear before you a Man as well as the reſt, and no Fryer.</hi> The Gentlewoman began to Smile, and ſaid; <hi>O ſadneſs!

                     <p>The young Woman, who had a Heart not of Steel or Diamond, was willing by all means to pleaſe the Abbot. The Monk, who had ſeign'd himſelf to have been gone for Wood, being in the Dormitory, when he ſaw the Abbot entring into his Chamber by himſelf, altogether raviſhed for joy, judged that his contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance

The Abbot, who was a witty Man, did preſently ſee, that he had not onely perceived ſomething more of him than was expedient, but that he likewiſe had ſeen what he had done: Therefore feeling a remorſe in his own conſcience, he would not condemn the Monk
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61071:161"/>for that fault which he was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of himſelf. So he granted him a pardon, and charged him to keep Silence, having honeſtly conveyed the young Maid out of the Cloyſter, whom they made often to return again.</p>

                     <head>The vile wickedneſs of a Monk, together with the ſhallowneſs and ſimplicity of a Nun.</head>
                     <p>IN one of the moſt famous Cities of <hi>France, Paris</hi> onely excepted, there is an Hoſpital richly endowed, conſiſting in a Priory of fifteen or ſixteen Nuns, and in an Appartment before it there is a Priory with ſeven or eight Monks, which did every day attend Divine Service; but as for the Nuns, they were onely to ſay their <hi>Pater-noſters</hi> and <hi>Ave-Maries,</hi> becauſe they were bound to attend the poor ſick Folks of the Hoſpital. Now it came to paſs that one of the poor men of the ſaid Hoſpital fell very dangerouſly ſick, and the Nuns
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61071:170"/>gathering themſelves together, did adminiſter all poſſible Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in order to his Recovery; but ſeeing him very ill, they ſent for the Confeſſor, and perceiving him to grow weaker and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they gave him the Extreme Unction, after which he preſently became ſpeechleſs. Now becauſe it was a long while before he could give up the ghoſt, and it ſeemed that he ſtill underſtood what was ſaid they did ſtrive to ſuggeſt to him the beſt words and expreſſions they were capable of; but it being already very late, and the dead time of the night, they grew weary, and went one after another to Bed, ſo that no body remained to bury the dead Corps but one of the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Nuns, together with the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61071:170"/>Confeſſor, whom, becauſe of his auſterity and ſtrictneſs of Life, ſhe feared even more than the Prior himſelf. Theſe two having uſed great Exclamations, and Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the ears of the poor man, and at laſt perceiving he was quite gone, they both aſſiſted to bury him; and becauſe they were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a good work of Mercy, this holy Monk began a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe about Mercy, the Frailty of this Life, and the Happineſs of the Life to come; ſo that they paſſed the beſt part of the night entertaining themſelves with ſuch Diſcourſes. The poor Nun did attentively hearken to his Divine Expreſſions, and looked upon him with tears in her eyes, in which this holy Father took
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61071:171"/>ſo much delight, that as he was ſpeaking of the Life to come, he embraced her as ſtraitly as if he had a mind to carry her preſently to Heaven in his Arms. The poor ſilly Nun hearkning to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, durſt not put him by, nor refuſe his Embraces. This damnable Hypocrite perceiving her ſimplicity, did proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and as he was ſtill ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her concerning God, and other ſpiritual things did commit with her the moſt obſcene Act of the Fleſh; and withal told her, that a ſecret ſin was not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before God, and that two ſingle Perſons cannot ſin in that caſe, if there ariſe no ſcandal of it; and to avoid that, ſhe ſhould beware of confeſſing her ſelf to any but himſelf. So they parted;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61071:171"/>but ſhe going her way the firſt, and paſſing by a Chappel dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe went to give her the Angels Salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ſhe uſed to do; but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Image of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> and knowing that ſhe had now forfeited the Honour of that Title and excellent Dignity, and that without any great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements, and leſs Love, but onely by a ſilly fear and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; ſhe then began to weep as bitterly as if her Heart had been ready to break. The Monk, who though afar off, heard her deep ſighs and groans, ſuſpecting her repentance, and fearing the loſs of his future Pleaſure in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of her, that he might divert her, came preſently to her, whom he found proſtrate at the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61071:172"/>feet of the ſaid Image; but he check'd her ſmartly, and told her, That if ſhe was ſo ſilly and ſcrupulous as to think ſhe had committed a ſin in ſo doing, that then ſhe ſhould do ſo no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe would, and that he was ready to give her Abſolution. This ſilly Soul thinking to make ſatisfaction to God for her ſin, went preſently to confeſs her ſin to him, who enjoyned her no other Penance, but onely told her, That ſhe had contracted no guilt of ſin in loving him, and that a drop or two of Holy-water would eaſily waſh away ſo inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant a Pecadillo. And ſhe putting more confidence in him than in God himſelf, did a while after yield again to his brutal deſire, who paid her ſo home,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61071:172"/>that her Belly began to ſwell; which the took ſo to heart, that making her Condition known to the Abbeſs, ſhe beſought her to expel that Monk out of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, telling her, That ſhe knew him to be ſo full of wiles, and ſo crafty, that ſhe feared ſhe ſhould not be able to withſtand his temptation, who would leave no ſtone unturn'd to inveagle her again. The Abbeſs and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our (who underſtood one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as being partners perhaps in the ſame guilt) did but laugh at her, telling her, That ſhe was of an age ſufficient to defend her ſelf from the attempts of one man, and that he whom ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed had always had the repute of a very ſober honeſt man: At length ſhe being exceedingly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented

He ſeeing the buſineſs ſhould not ſmell well if it ſhould be ſtir'd from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bottom, anſwers them (which he all along thought to do, if ſo be they ſhould call him to an account) he had no reaſon to give them any account, for whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Money he had, it was his own and not theirs, and as to the Lands they were his by Law, by reaſon they were all bought under his Name, and no Bodies elſe (for the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> for fear of being diſcovered, make always their Lands to be bought under one Gentlemans Name.) The <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> Aſtoniſhed and Surprized at this his talking, knew not what to ſay, eſpecially living amongſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (whom they call <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi>)
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61071:176"/>where if they ſhould go to Law under the name of Prieſts, they ſhould not onely forfeit their Eſtates, but (according to the Statute) loſe their Lives alſo, for receiving Orders beyond Sea. After they had long debated the matter among them, at laſt they reſolved to go to Law, rather than loſe all; and that they might not be diſcovered as Jeſuits, to plead as Perſons Secular, wrong'd by this now Eſquire <hi>Travers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they had Indicted this holy Father, and came to the Bar, the Pleadings were ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and nonſenſical, that the Judges knew not what to ſay, for want of clear Evidence in the matter: till at laſt, as wiſe and prudent Men, (eſpecially ſome of them knowing what <hi>Travers</hi>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:61071:177"/>was) they perceived they were all Prieſts; and ſo, not without laughter and admiration, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the controverted Bone among them, deſired them to agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, for that the matter was ſo obſcure, as that it could not be (the things being as they were) decided at the Bench. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were now in a worſe condition than before, and knew not what to do, or what to think in this matter; all the Tenants of the Lands taking this <hi>Travers</hi> for their lawful Landlord, and the Moneys being in his hands and command; ſo they deſired him to come to a Compoſition. He not deſigning to defraud them of all, did agree to it, but ſtill reſerving the greateſt part of the Moneys and Lands to his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61071:177"/>own uſe, made the reſt over to the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Being now ſo well furniſhed with Goods and Lands, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to marry, that ſo he might have Heirs to whom to leave his Eſtate: And yet neither would he turn <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> for fear of loſing his Reputation; neither could he take a Wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> in Orders. But at laſt he found out a way whereby he might ſtill continue of that Religion, and be no more a Prieſt, and by that means have freedom to take a Wife, <hi>nemine contradicente.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He therefore comes to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Carmelite</hi> Fryer, and with a great complaint and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs of heart tells him, that he was perſuaded he was never
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61071:178"/>baptized: For, ſaith be, in all the Regiſter books of many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, and particularly in that where I was born, I do not find my Name; whether it was by the negligence of my Father, or how it hapned, I do not know: but ſure I am, I am not baptized.</p>
                     <p>The good old Frier was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely amazed at it; and though he could not at the firſt be perſuaded of any ſuch thing, yet at laſt, by the great aſſurance of the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> and his forged Reaſons and Arguments tending to that purpoſe, he believed him. The <hi>Jeſuit</hi> ſeeing his Buſineſs went on ſo well, deſired at laſt his Brother would be pleaſed to do him that charitable deed as to baptiſe him; for he was afraid to be damn'd for ever, becauſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61071:178"/>he was not as yet inſerted into the true Church, out of whoſe Boſom there is no hopes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The old <hi>Carmelite</hi> did it willingly, and accordingly he was baptiſed. Now he being put in Orders, and having made the profeſſion of a Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, emitted his Vows, and done all the reſt of thoſe Trumperies belonging to a Regular Prieſt's Life, without being baptiſed, was not onely not bound to continue as he was, but <hi>ipſo facto</hi> he was counted as Irregular; and if he would be a Perſon Eccleſiaſtick, he was to take Ordes anew upon him, and to make a ſecond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. But ſo wiſe he was, that he never returned to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> but continued a Perſon Secular, living in that ſame Religion (that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61071:179"/>they ſhould not think him to be an Apoſtate, or to have done that Trick to the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> becauſe he intended to turn <hi>Proteſtant;</hi>) and ſo married a Wife, which was the only reaſon of his rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization, and hath begot ſeveral Children on her. How he now liveth, and what his Condition is, I was not ſo curious as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. As far as his Cunning, and his Brothers Simplicity did reach, I have here depoſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither willing to offend the parties, nor to have their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples imitated.</p>
